Welcome to my Python-powered EDA project where I dive deep into the Amazon Prime Video catalog to uncover content trends, genre preferences, and strategic insights. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, visualization, and storytelling using Python and its data stack.

## 🔍 Objective

To analyze the Prime Video dataset and answer key business questions such as:
- Distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows
